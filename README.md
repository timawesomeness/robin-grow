Step 1: Install a userscript extension such as greasemonkey or tampermonkey:

Click here: http://tampermonkey.net

Then, click this link to install the script:

https://github.com/timawesomeness/robin-lmao/raw/master/robin.user.js

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.

Once you do that, refresh your robin page and you will be AYY LMAOing!
